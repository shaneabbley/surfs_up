# Surfing Analysis

### Overview of the analysis
#### Background
W. Avy wants to see the statistics for the weather in Oahu during the months of July and December. In order to accomplish this we used Jupyter Notebooks
to run SQLalchemy queries on an SQLite database.
### Results
#### We obtained the following data from our queries:
* The average temperature in Oahu during the month of June is 74.9 degrees, while the average temperature in December is 71.0 degrees.
* The standard deviation in temperature in Oahu during the month of June is 3.25 degrees, while the standard deviation in temperature in December is 3.75 degrees.
* June has 1700 temperature data points and December has 1517 temperature data points.

### Summary
#### Discussion
It seems that the Ice cream stand and surf shop has the potential to succeed all year round because the weather is nice in both summer and winter. The weather is also remarkably consistant due to the low standard deviation in both months. Lastly, because June has more datapoints it is slightly more robust data. 
#### Future Analysis
There are two queries that would increase the efficacy of our analysis. Firstly, performing the same query for March/September would give us insight into weather conditions during the Spring/Fall. I would also suggest analyzing precipitation amounts by month and cloudiness per month. Both of these metrics would likely have an effect on our business performance.
